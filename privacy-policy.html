  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 29, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Modern Industries</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the <strong>Issue Tracking App</strong> (the “App”), developed exclusively for internal operational use by Modern Industries employees.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not collect</strong> personally identifiable information (PII) such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Precise or approximate location</li>
    <li>Contacts or calendar events</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App collects limited technical data solely for performance diagnostics and compatibility:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and model (e.g., Android)</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Application version</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is never shared or sold to any third party and is used only to improve the performance and reliability of the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Image Uploads and Cloud Storage</h2>
  <p>During configuration activities (such as adding machines), authorized personnel (e.g., administrators) may upload images using the App. These images are securely stored using <strong>Cloudinary</strong>, a GDPR- and CCPA-compliant cloud-based media storage service.</p>
  <p>Cloudinary may store data on servers located outside India, including the United States. All transfers are encrypted in transit using HTTPS, and the service provider maintains compliance with international data protection frameworks.</p>
<p>Image URLs are stored in a secure, access-controlled cloud database. This database is hosted in a private cloud infrastructure with strict access and encryption protocols. Data is never made public or shared with any third parties without explicit authorization from Modern Industries.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App requests the following permissions at runtime, only for use by authorized administrative personnel while performing specific tasks such as machine profile configuration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture machine images during setup.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To select and upload existing machine-related images from the device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are not requested or required during regular usage by standard employees. The App does not access these resources unless explicitly initiated by authorized users. Permission access is governed by role-based access control mechanisms implemented within the App’s authentication system.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not include</strong> advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs. The only third-party service integrated is <strong>Cloudinary</strong>, which is used strictly for secure, internal media hosting as part of configuration workflows.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is intended strictly for use by authorized employees of Modern Industries. It is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, process, or retain data from minors. If such data is identified, it is immediately and permanently deleted.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All data transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS. The backend, including cloud-based infrastructure used for image metadata and media storage, is protected by modern security protocols including encryption at rest and in transit.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Uploaded images and associated metadata are retained only as long as necessary to complete configuration or issue resolution tasks. Data is periodically reviewed and deleted based on internal retention schedules. Specific deletion requests can be submitted via an employee’s reporting manager or IT administrator.</p>

  <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time due to operational, legal, or technical changes. Updates will be posted within the App and/or on our official website, with the revised effective date clearly indicated. Continued use of the App constitutes acknowledgment of the updated policy.</p>
